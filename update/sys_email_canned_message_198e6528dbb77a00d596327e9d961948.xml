<p style="font-size: 11px;">Dear [insert]:</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px;">On behalf of NORCAL Mutual Insurance Company (“NORCAL”), please allow this letter to follow up on our prior correspondence to [insert name of recipient(s)], dated [Month Date, Year], acknowledging receipt of [insert description of what we received] in connection with the above-referenced matter (“the [<em>insert</em>] Matter/Action”).]  <span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>[OR, if this correspondence is the first correspondence that’s being issued to the insured since the matter was first submitted to the company, then say:</em></strong></span>  On behalf of NORCAL Mutual Insurance Company (“NORCAL”), please allow this correspondence to confirm that on [Month Date, Year], NORCAL received notice of [insert description of what we received] in connection with the above-referenced matter (the “[<em>insert</em>] Matter/Action”).<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span>  We take this opportunity to inform you that NORCAL will continue to defend [<strong><em>OR:</em></strong> defend] [insert name of the insured] in the [insert name of the matter] under a reservation of rights.  <span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>[If the letter is addressed to someone other than the insured, then add this sentence to the end of this paragraph:  </em></strong></span>To the extent you are not the representative of [insert name of the insured] for communications regarding insurance coverage for the [insert name of the matter], please let us know to whom we should direct correspondence regarding coverage as soon as possible.<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px;">We summarize below the allegations reflected in the [insert] so that you will understand the context of NORCAL’s coverage position, but you should refer to the [insert] itself for the complete allegations therein.  Please appreciate that NORCAL is not expressing any view on the truth of such allegations.  NORCAL invites you to provide us with any information you believe may be relevant to the coverage issues discussed below.  This letter should be read in conjunction with the Policy.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: center;"><strong>The Facts</strong></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>[If we received a copy of a complaint, then you can say:</em></strong>  On [Month Date, Year], [list all of the plaintiffs by name] filed a [insert] against [list all of the defendants, including non-insureds].  <strong><em>[OR, if we received a Notice of Intent/Demand letter/ whatever else that preceded the complaint along with a complaint, describe that first.  If there’s a letter, then start by explaining who sent it (if applicable, explain if someone sent it on someone else’s behalf), the date of the letter, to whom it was issued, and then summarize what it says.]</em></strong></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>[Insert </em></strong><strong><em>your</em></strong><strong><em> summary of the asserted allegations.  This may take up several paragraphs, but that’s okay.  Try to cover every category of allegations that are asserted.  For example, if the complaint has 20 sentences that all basically say that the insured acted with intent to harm the claimant, then you don’t need to summarize every sentence that alleges intent to harm; a couple sentences summarizing the allegation will suffice.  On the other hand, if there’s an allegation that the insured fudged the medical record and acted with intent to harm, then be sure that your summary notes both allegations.]</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px;"><span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>[If you are summarizing a complaint, then include this at the end of your summary:</em></strong>  </span>Based on the foregoing allegations, the [Complaint/FAC/etc.] asserts causes of action against the Defendants for: (1) --; (2) --; ….  [list all of the causes of action, but be careful to note if certain COA’s are only brought against certain defendants].  The Plaintiffs seek to recover [list all of the relief that the plaintiffs seek, regardless of whether you think it’s covered or not].<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>[If we received additional information or materials (i.e., responses to demand letters, information we learned through talking with the insured or defense counsel, etc.), be sure to include that in chronological order IF it’s important to the procedural status of what’s going on in the claim, the defense of the claim, the coverage analysis, or for some other reason.  So, for example, if we received a copy of the Answer to the Complaint, we won’t need to summarize that unless there’s something in the Answer that affects coverage, defense of the case, etc.]</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: center;"><strong>The Policy</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px;">Subject to its terms and conditions, NORCAL issued [insert the name of the policy (i.e., Medical Professional Liability Insurance Policy)] No. [insert number] to [insert Named Insured] for the [insert the policy period in Month Date, Year format] Policy Period [<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>if applicable, insert:</em></strong> </span>, with a Retroactive Date of May 27, 2016].  The Policy is written on a claims-made and reported basis and provides coverage in the amount of [insert amount] per [insert the event- Claim, Administrative Proceeding, etc.] and [insert amount] in the aggregate for each Policy Period under Coverage [insert], which is the only potentially applicable Coverage Part of the Policy.  <span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>[If there has been any erosion of the applicable limit of liability or the aggregate limit of liability, note that here.  Also, if there is a deductible, you should note that in this section, as well, and explain whether the deductible applies to defense costs and/or indemnity.  Finally, if the claim involves more than one insured, note whether the limits are shared, separate, etc.  Depending on all of the info being relayed, you may need to break your discussion down into several paragraphs.]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>[If you are analyzing coverage for an insured that is not the Named Insured, then you’ll need to explain how the individual/entity qualifies as an insured and what limits are available to that individual/entity and what, if any, limitations to coverage there are.  Here is a sample:</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 36px;">Subject to its terms and conditions, NORCAL issued Medical Professional Liability Insurance Policy number 123 to ABC Co. for the October 31, 2016 to October 31, 2017 Policy Period.[fn that says “except for headings….”]  Pursuant to Endorsement Sequence Number 4, you, Jane Doe, MD, were added as an Insured to the Policy, but only while acting within the course and scope of your duties for ABC Co.  The Policy is written on a claims made and reported basis and provides a separate limit of liability of $50,000 each Administrative Proceeding or Employment-Related Civil Action and $150,000 in the aggregate under Coverage B, which is the only potentially applicable Coverage Part of the Policy.[fn that explains why the other coverage parts aren’t triggered]<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: center;"><strong>WHO IS AN INSURED</strong></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>[This section will not always be necessary.  It will be necessary if there are multiple defendants or claims being asserted against multiple individuals/entities and not everyone is an insured.  Here is a sample:</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 36px;">As noted above, ABC Co. and Jane Doe are Insureds under the Policy.  In contrast, DEF Co. and John Doe do not appear to be Insureds under the Policy.  Accordingly, the Policy does not afford coverage for DEF Co. or John Doe with respect to the <em>Example </em>Action.  If you disagree with our understanding in this regard, please notify us immediately and provide us with any relevant documentation, at which time we would be pleased to review NORCAL’s position.</p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>Here’s another sample:</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 36px;">As noted above, ABC Co. was added as an Insured to Coverage Part A pursuant to Endorsement Sequence Number 1, and Jan Doe, John Doe, and Jimmy Doe were added as Insureds to Coverage Parts A and C pursuant to Endorsement Number 2.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 36px;">In addition, DEF Co. and Jack Doe are not Named Insureds under the Policy, nor were they added as Insureds via an Endorsement to the Policy.  Accordingly, the Policy does not afford coverage for DEF Co. and Jack Doe with respect to the <em>Sample</em> Action.  If you disagree with our understanding in this regard, please notify us immediately and provide us with any relevant documentation, at which time we would be pleased to review NORCAL’s position.<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; text-align: center;"><strong>coverage analysis</strong></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>[Always start by reciting the pertinent parts of the applicable coverage part’s insuring agreement and explaining whether the insuring agreement is triggered.]</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px;">Under the insuring agreement provided in Coverage [insert], the Policy provides the following, in relevant part:</p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 72px;"><strong><em>[Sample:</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 72px;">We will pay Damages, up to the applicable limits of coverage for Medical Professional Liability Insurance, on behalf of an Insured because of a Medical Incident that takes place within the Coverage Territory on or after the Insured’s Retroactive Date . . . and that results in a Claim first made against that Insured, and first reported to Us, during the Policy Period.  . . . .<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;">[citation].  <strong><em>[Now, recite the pertinent parts of the relevant terms’ definitions, including citations to where the definition can be found in the policy.  Then explain why the insuring agreement is triggered and reserve rights, where appropriate.  For example, if the allegations indicate that some of the acts/omissions don’t or may not constitute a </em></strong><strong><em>Professional Health Care Service</em></strong><strong><em>, reserve rights on that issue; if the act may have occurred prior to the Retro Date, reserve rights; if some of the relief that is sought does not constitute </em></strong><strong><em>Damages</em></strong><strong><em>, reserve rights.  This discussion may take more than one paragraph.  Here’s a sample:</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 36px;"><strong>Claim</strong> is defined, in part, as a “demand received for money or <strong>damages</strong> including the service of <strong>suit</strong> . . . against any insured arising out of a <strong>medical incident</strong> and reported during the <strong>policy period</strong>.”  [Citation]  <strong>Medical</strong> <strong>incident</strong> is defined, in relevant part, to mean “an event due to <strong>professional services</strong>, acts or omissions arising out of treatment to a patient which could or did result in <strong>bodily injury</strong>. . . .”  [Citation]  The <em>Example</em> Action appears to be a <strong>claim</strong> as it is a demand for money or <strong>damages</strong> against an <strong>insured</strong> (yourself) that arises out of a <strong>medical incident</strong> (your treatment of Mr. Patient) that occurred subsequent to the retroactive date of October 20, 1989.  As this matter was first reported to Medicus on June 26, 2014, the <strong>claim</strong> was reported to Medicus during the <strong>policy period</strong>.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 36px;">We also direct you to the Policy’s definition of “<strong>Damages</strong>”, which includes “only those actual or compensatory damages resulting from <strong>bodily injury</strong>, sickness, disability or death.”  The definition further provides that “<strong>Damages</strong> do not include punitive, exemplary, statutory damages or other fines.”  As noted above, Mr. Patient seeks exemplary damages, which are outside the scope of the Policy’s definition of <strong>Damages</strong>.  To the extent costs of suit or attorneys’ fees and/or costs are awarded in connection with uncovered amounts, such amounts are likewise not covered by the Policy and would not be considered <strong>Damages</strong>.  Medicus further reserves its rights to the extent the plaintiff seeks redress outside the scope of the insuring agreement, or which does not otherwise constitute <strong>Damages</strong>.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; text-align: center;"><strong>RESERVATION OF RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The [insert name of the matter] implicates a number of other Policy terms and provisions that NORCAL would like to bring to your attention without prejudice to relying on other Policy provisions not specifically stated in this letter.  Please be advised that NORCAL expressly reserves all rights and defenses available under the Policy and applicable law with respect to coverage for the above-referenced matter, and that NORCAL does not intend to waive any coverage defense that may be available to it, regardless of whether that defense is specifically stated in this letter.  NORCAL’s position as to coverage for this matter is based on the information currently available to it.  NORCAL reserves the right to supplement its coverage position as additional information becomes available, as developments warrant, or for any other reason.</p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>[This is where you recite applicable exclusions and other policy terms, as applicable.  After you recite each exclusion or policy term, provide a brief explanation as to why you are reserving your rights.  For example, if you’re reserving rights on the willful acts exclusion, note that the plaintiff alleges that the insured acted intentionally.]</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; text-align: center;"><strong>DEFENSE</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Pursuant to Coverage A, NORCAL has “the duty and exclusive right, using counsel of Our choice, to investigate, negotiate, and defend a Claim resulting from a Medical Incident, covered under Section A (Indemnity) . . . by the payment of Defense Costs and Additional Benefits, which are payable in addition to the applicable Each Claim Limit for Medical Professional Liability Insurance.”  Policy Part II.B.1.  NORCAL’s duty to defend ends, however, after the applicable limits of liability have been exhausted in accordance with Part V (Limits of Coverage) of the Policy.  <em>Id</em>.  Please also note that pursuant to [citation], the “Each Claim Limit shown on the Declarations Page is the most We will pay for all Damages arising from a Medical Incident . . . .”<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em> [If applicable:</em></strong>  </span>As you know, NORCAL has agreed to provide you with a defense in the [insert name of the matter] and has referred this matter to Attorney [insert name] of [insert name of the firm], who has been defending you in this matter.<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #00ba63; font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><strong><em>[Depending on your reservation of rights and the applicable jurisdiction, you may need to advise the insured that it/he/she has the right to be defended by independent counsel.  C&amp;L will help you determine whether that’s necessary and advise you of the specific language you need to include, which will depend on the various jurisdictions.]</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">NORCAL also wishes to call to your attention certain Policy provisions bearing on the defense and settlement of Claims.  First, [citation], outlines your duties in the event of a Claim.  Second, pursuant to [citation], NORCAL “shall not be liable for the cost of legal services or any other costs of defense incurred by any <strong>insured </strong>without our prior written consent.”  Third, pursuant to [citation], “[NORCAL] will not settle any Claim against an Insured . . . without the [Insured’s] consent.”  Please also note that while we may do so, NORCAL does not have a duty to recommend settlement of a Claim.  [Citation]</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;"><span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>[If applicable:</em>  </strong></span>Please further be advised that pursuant to <em>Buss v. Superior Court</em>, 16 Cal. 4th 35 (1997), we are asserting our right to obtain reimbursement for all defense costs allocated to non-covered claims and we further reserve the right to require allocation or apportionment of defense costs to non-covered claim.<span style="color: #00ba63;"><strong><em>]</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="font-size: 11px;">Please appreciate that NORCAL’s coverage position is based on the information currently available to it.  If you believe that NORCAL has misunderstood any aspect of this matter, please let us know and provide us with any relevant information, at which time NORCAL would be pleased to review its position.  Please note further that NORCAL fully reserves all of its rights under the Policy and applicable law, that the above discussion is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive, and that there may be other terms and conditions of the Policy which, although not specifically mentioned in this letter, may apply to this matter.  NORCAL reserves the right to assert any additional Policy term or condition that might be applicable, or as circumstances may warrant as additional information becomes available.  NORCAL’s actions in investigating, evaluating, and/or monitoring this matter should not be construed as a waiver, estoppel, or other relinquishment of NORCAL’s rights to limit or deny coverage, nor as any admission of any obligation under the Policy.</p>
